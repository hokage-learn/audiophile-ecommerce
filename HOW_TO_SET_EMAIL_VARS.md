# üîß How to Set Email Environment Variables in Convex

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Convex Does NOT Read `.env.local`

You **must** set environment variables in the **Convex Dashboard**, not in `.env.local`.

The `.env.local` file only works for Next.js variables (like `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL`).
Convex Actions (like email sending) **require variables to be set in the Convex Dashboard**.

## ‚úÖ Verify Your Setup

After adding all variables:

1. Go back to your Next.js app
2. Try to checkout with a test order
3. Open the **Convex Dashboard ‚Üí Logs**
4. Look for email-related logs
5. You should see:
   - `‚úÖ Email sent successfully!` = Success!
   - `‚ùå Missing SMTP_HOST` = Variable not set properly

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "SMTP_HOST is Missing"
- **Fix:** Make sure you added `SMTP_HOST` in Convex Dashboard (not `.env.local`)

### Issue: "Authentication failed"
- **Fix:** Make sure you're using an **App Password**, not your regular Gmail password
- **Fix:** Make sure `SMTP_USER` is your full email address (with @gmail.com)

### Issue: Emails not arriving
- **Fix:** Check your spam/junk folder
- **Fix:** Verify the `to` email address in the logs
- **Fix:** Gmail has a daily sending limit (500 emails/day)

### Issue: "Connection timeout"
- **Fix:** Make sure `SMTP_HOST` is correct
- **Fix:** Check if `SMTP_PORT` is correct (587 for Gmail TLS)

## üìù Quick Checklist

Before trying checkout, verify:

- [ ] All 5 variables added in **Convex Dashboard** (not `.env.local`)
- [ ] `SMTP_HOST` = `smtp.gmail.com` (or your provider)
- [ ] `SMTP_PORT` = `587`
- [ ] `SMTP_USER` = Your full email address
- [ ] `SMTP_PASSWORD` = App Password (16 characters, not regular password)
- [ ] `EMAIL_FROM` = Your full email address
- [ ] 2-Step Verification enabled on Gmail
- [ ] App Password generated and copied correctly
- [ ] Checked Convex Dashboard ‚Üí Logs for errors

---

## üÜò Still Not Working?

Check the Convex Dashboard ‚Üí Logs immediately after checkout:

1. Click **"Logs"** in the left sidebar
2. Filter by time (last 5 minutes)
3. Look for entries with `sendEmail` or `Email`
4. Read the error message carefully
5. Follow the specific error fix above

**Common fixes:**
- Regenerate App Password if authentication fails
- Double-check all variable names (case-sensitive!)
- Make sure no extra spaces in values
- Wait 1-2 minutes after adding variables for them to propagate

**Remember:** Convex environment variables are **separate** from Next.js environment variables. You need to set them in **TWO places**:
1. **Convex Dashboard** ‚Üí For email sending (SMTP_* variables)
2. **`.env.local`** ‚Üí For Next.js variables (NEXT_PUBLIC_*)
