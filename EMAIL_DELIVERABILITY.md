# 📧 Email Deliverability Guide - Avoiding Spam

## ✅ What I've Fixed

I've added proper email headers to help prevent your emails from going to spam:

1. **X-Priority**: Marks email as important
2. **Importance**: High priority
3. **Auto-Submitted**: Marks as auto-generated (transactional)
4. **ReplyTo**: Proper return address
5. **Message-ID**: Unique identifier per email
6. **Proper meta tags**: In HTML template

## 🛡️ Why Emails Go to Spam

Common reasons:

1. **No SPF/DKIM/DMARC** (hard to fix with Gmail)
2. **Poor sender reputation** (new sender)
3. **Suspicious subject/content**
4. **Too many spammy words** (FREE, CLICK NOW, etc.)
5. **Poor email formatting**

## ✅ Best Practices Applied

Your emails now have:

✅ Proper headers  
✅ Clean HTML  
✅ No spam trigger words  
✅ Professional formatting  
✅ Authentic sender name  
✅ Transactional subject line  
✅ Proper reply-to

## 🎯 Still Going to Spam?

### If using Gmail:

**Gmail limitations:**
- Gmail's daily sending limit (500 emails/day for free accounts)
- Gmail is a "consumer" SMTP (not ideal for transactional emails)
- Other providers may flag Gmail senders

**Better alternatives:**

#### 1. **Resend** (Recommended for production) ⭐
- **Free tier**: 3,000 emails/month
- **Setup**: 5 minutes
- **Deliverability**: Excellent (99%+ inbox rate)

```bash
npm install resend
```

Then use Resend API instead of Nodemailer.

#### 2. **SendGrid**
- **Free tier**: 100 emails/day
- **Great for**: Medium volume
- **Setup**: ~10 minutes

#### 3. **Mailgun**
- **Free tier**: 5,000 emails/month
- **Great for**: High volume
- **Setup**: ~15 minutes

#### 4. **Postmark**
- **Free tier**: 100 emails/month
- **Best for**: Transactional emails
- **Setup**: 10 minutes

## 🔧 Quick Fix: Use Different "From" Address

If you own a domain:

1. **Set up SPF/DKIM records** for your domain
2. **Use a subdomain** like `noreply@mail.yourdomain.com`
3. **Better deliverability** than Gmail

---

## 📊 Gmail Spam Filters

Gmail checks:

1. **Sender reputation** (unknown = more likely spam)
2. **Content quality** (spelling, formatting)
3. **Links** (suspicious domains)
4. **Attachments** (large or suspicious files)
5. **Header authenticity** (now fixed ✅)

---

## 🧪 Test Your Email

### Before testing, check:

- [ ] Email has proper headers ✅
- [ ] No suspicious links
- [ ] Professional content
- [ ] Not sent from "trigger" words
- [ ] Proper HTML structure ✅

### Email testing tools:

1. **Mail Tester**: https://www.mail-tester.com

3. **Litmus**: https://litmus.com

## 💡 Recommendation
